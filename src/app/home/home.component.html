    <h3>ServiceNow Developer | Full-Stack Engineer</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a developer who enjoys building tools that actually solve problemsâ€”whether
      that's automating ServiceNow workflows with Virtual Agents and Flow Designer, 
      or crafting real-time Angular dashboards that make complex data easy to navigate.
      My background spans frontend work at NielsenIQ, full-stack builds at Innoart,
      and ServiceNow platform development at CubeSimple. I've also built side projects
      ranging from Discord music bots to stock portfolio trackers, mostly because
      I like seeing ideas turn into working software. My approach is
      straightforward: write clean code, test thoroughly, and keep improving based
      on what breaks.
